# Project Overview

Telen HR, a fictional HR solutions provider, was engaged by a client to analyze its employee data in order to better understand workforce composition, and salary distribution. This analysis aims to uncover patterns and imbalances that may affect workforce planning, compensation fairness, and overall talent management decisions.

To achieve this, the project focuses on the following business problems:

- **Assessing whether the workforce is well-balanced** across age groups, roles, and other key employee segments.
- **Identifying potential pay disparities** to determine if there are unfair differences in compensation across comparable employee groups.

# Executive Summary

The workforce at Telen HR appears generally well-balanced, with a healthy age distribution and no major compensation disparities across age groups or gender. Employee counts decline progressively with age, which aligns with typical workforce structures, and average salaries increase with age and career progression. While male employees slightly outnumber female employees, pay levels across genders remain largely comparable.

# Key Insights

- **Age Distribution:**
    
    The workforce is evenly spread across age groups, with the 30–39 age group having the highest number of employees, followed by 20–29. Employee numbers decrease steadily in older age groups, indicating a natural workforce pyramid with fewer senior employees.
    
- **Gender Distribution:**
    
    Male employees (3,671) outnumber female employees (3,013) by 658, with a small group (14 employees) identifying as other. Despite this imbalance in headcount, representation across genders remains relatively close.
    
- **Pay by Age Group:**
    
    Average salaries increase across higher age groups, reflecting normal career progression and increased experience. No abnormal salary gaps are observed between adjacent age groups.
    
- **Pay by Gender:**
    
    Average salaries are broadly aligned across genders. Male employees earn an average of approximately 120,000, female employees about 110,000, and employees identifying as other around 120,000, suggesting no significant pay inequality.
    

# Recommendations

- **Maintain the current compensation structure while monitoring gender pay trends**
    
    Although salaries are largely balanced across age groups and genders, the slight average pay difference between male and female employees should be monitored over time. Regular pay audits will help ensure compensation remains fair as the workforce grows and roles evolve.
    
- **Strengthen workforce succession and age diversity planning**
    
    With employee numbers declining in higher age groups, The business should invest in targeted training, mentorship, and career progression programs to prepare younger employees for senior roles and reduce future leadership gaps.
